# CucumberProject2
My project is a java based maven script using Junit as my base of my cucumber BDD framework. i have a steps class to run my step definitions, i have my pages class to add all my locators from each class. i have features file to have all my test cases and my @Smoke and @Regression tags for each senario. i have my pom.xml to put all my dependencies and plugs that i used thoughout my project. lastly i have my runner class to run all my senarios. in my runner class i have my cucumber reports plug in to get a nice html report.

i used POM design pattern to make my project more dynamic so i dont have to keep repeating my code and making it redundent.
i use UTILITIES like driver, waiter
